# Railway Multigraphs

### Introduction

In this project, I use multigraphs and variations of Dijkstra's Shortest Path to model passenger rail networks. In addition to using the standard version of Dijkstra's Algorithm that finds the shortest path by distance, I created a modified version that finds the *cheapest* path, considering multiple railway operators and transfers between them.

### Data Structure: Multigraph

A multigraph is a graph that can have parallel edges, or in other words, multiple edges that connect the same two nodes. These are the main abstract considerations I had in applying it to passenger rail networks:

- **Parallel edges** (use a multigraph instead of a graph): Different rail lines can connect the same two stations.
- **All weighted edges**: The distance traversed between stations is fundamental to creating an itinerary.
- **All undirected edges**: While single-direction railways may exist somewhere, I'm assuming there will always be service in both directions in this project.
- **No self-loops**: It wouldn't make sense to leave and come back to the same station without going to any other stations.
- **Cyclic**: There can be circle routes or other cycles achievable through transfers.

### Algorithm: Dijkstra's Shortest Path

Dijkstra's shortest path finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes, or to a specific destination node, as I implement here. In other words, considering the weights of the edges, it finds which path would result in the minimum sum of edge weights. I have both a distance version, where edge weights are fixed, and a cost version, where edge weights are dynamic and depend on the fare structures of the rail lines and transfers between them.

### Building, Testing, and Running the Project

The project requires C++20. Here is one possible sequence of steps for building, testing, and running it on Mac/Linux. (Slight modifications are necessary on Windows.)

```zsh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug # Or just `cmake ..` for no debugging
make
./railway_multigraphs # To print the toy data results
ctest --verbose # To see the tests pass for more cases than are printed
```

### Toy Data Example Visualization

Here is one example of the visualizations I made using [graphonline.top](https://graphonline.top). The other toy data images can be found in [the `toy_data_viz` subdirectory](toy_data_viz/) along with `.graphml` files that can be opened and edited on the website.
